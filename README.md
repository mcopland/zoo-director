# Zoo Director

A zoo-management game where different animals have different initial costs, maintenance costs, and profit. Random events occur to challenge the player.

## Gameplay

The player is tasked with running a zoo. Each animal species has a different initial price, maintenance cost, and daily profit. The player begins with a set amount of money and three choices of animals. Each turn is a "day" and with each day all animals increase in age and any expenses are deducted from the bank. Random events will occur with either a negative or positive outcome. Gameplay continues until the player runs out of money or decides to quit.
